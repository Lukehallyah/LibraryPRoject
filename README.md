# LibraryPRoject


What theOdinProject wants me to implement:

1)Store the Objects in an array
2)Create a Constructor function that 
    creates a book
    stores the book object in an array
    each book has unique id using (crypto.randomUUID())
    
    
    Basic Structure: 
        const myLibrary = [];

            function Book() {
                // the constructor...
            }

            function addBookToLibrary() {
                // take params, create a book then store it in the array
            }
            
3) Write a function to loop through the
    array. Display however I want (table
    or card).
4)Add a "New Book" button (finished) to 
    add a book to library. 
    
5)Add a button on each book's display to 
    remove the book from the library.
    
6) Add a button on each book to change its
    read status
